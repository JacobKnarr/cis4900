Android Studio Setup
	- Open Android Studio
	- Select "Import Project(Gradle, Eclipse ADT, etc.)"
	- Navigate to the "w18-sec-4-group-3-project" directory
	- Select the "forcastie-master" directory
	- Click the OK button
	- It should begin to set up the project, give it a minute or two
	- If you see a message about a CVS root click the expand arrow and select "Add root"

That should get things set up mostly, you can view code and layouts in the "app" directory in android studio.
